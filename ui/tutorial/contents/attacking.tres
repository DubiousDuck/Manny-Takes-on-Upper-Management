Click on the unit to see what attacks are available. When you hover over them, you can see the range that each attack can be used in.

To use an attack, choose one on the list and select a valid target (highlighted in [color=yellow]YELLOW[/color]).
If you don't see any yellow highlights, that means there are no valid targets yet. Consider moving the unit to a closer square or select another skill.
