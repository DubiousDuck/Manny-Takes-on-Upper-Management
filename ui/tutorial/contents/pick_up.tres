Upon using this skill, the Protag will pick an allied unit up and carries it. When the Protag moves when carrying a unit, the unit will move with the Protag.

Carrying a unit also unlocks the [color=khaki]Throw[/color] skill, which throws the carried unit at a target location.
If there is an enemy at the target location, it will be knocked back.
